Customer Spending Analysis: Impact of Engagement Metrics:

In this project, I analyzed a Kaggle dataset to explore how key customer engagement metricsâ€”Average Session Length, Time on App, Time on Website, and Length of Membershipâ€”affect the Yearly Amount Spent by customers.

Key Insights:
Length of Membership is the most significant factor influencing customer spending, showing a strong positive correlation. ðŸ’³
Time on App also proves crucial, with mobile engagement driving higher spending. ðŸ“±âœ¨
Model Performance:
The model's accuracy was impressive, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 22.58 and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 27.54.
